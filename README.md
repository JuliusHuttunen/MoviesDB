## Install

Clone the repository into the directory of your choice.

```
git clone https://github.com/JuliusHuttunen/MoviesDB.git
```

## Usage

Run the project with a compatible IDE of your choice. May need some work to get it running depending on your setup. Alternatively you can run it as a docker container.

## API

Swagger/OpenAPI documentation and try-it-outs at endpoint ``/api/docs``. Use the query ``/api-docs`` on Swagger's search/explore bar.

Note: Swagger displays relational data as ``string``, which isn't true in the context of the program. When making 
POST or PUT requests it's better to just leave relational data ``null`` and update the data later, as relational data has dedicated endpoint mappings for updating.

## Live

The app is deployed [here](https://moviedb-postgresql.herokuapp.com/api/docs).

## Keycloak

Client-id is ``my-spring-app``. Further Keycloak credentials will be provided here after the app is reviewed by Noroff to preserve database integrity.
