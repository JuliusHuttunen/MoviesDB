## Install

Clone the repository into the directory of your choice.

```
git clone https://github.com/JuliusHuttunen/MoviesDB.git
```

## Usage

Run the project with a compatible IDE of your choice. May need some work to get it running depending on your setup.

## API

Swagger/OpenAPI documentation at endpoint ``/api/docs``. 

Note: Swagger displays relational data as strings, which isn't true in the context of the program. When making 
POST or PUT requests it's better to just leave relational data ``null`` and update the data later, as relational data has dedicated endpoint mappings for updating.


[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a great tool to handle and test API requests as well.
